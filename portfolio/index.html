                <h5>Web <span>Developer</span></h5>
                <p>My name is <span>Kyaw Phyo Naing</span> and I’ve been developing websites for about over one years now. I am self-taught, but I honestly believe that with the amount of tutorials on YouTube, and in the Web Development community, one can
                    learn everything–including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Mysql, PHP and Laravel, without going to college. I’ve tried to make my living as a <span>Web Developer</span> , but now with my first baby on the way, I am looking for a job-security,
                    and decided to apply for the position you advertise. Besides work I am just a normal family man who enjoys spending time with his wife, and working in the IT field in his life time.</p>
